Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Heart Failure Patients

## About The Project

A supporting tool for doctors and heart failure patients to predict mortality of heart failure patients.
This platform makes use of data science and machine learning algorithms capable of classifying heart failure patient will survive or not.This allows the corresponding medical staff and patients to risk stratification and assume mortality supported by the artificial intelligent system, so they can follow-up the corresponding treatments.

### Motivation

Some facts:
- Approximately 18 million people dies globally each year from Cardiovascular diseases, mainly exhibit as Heart failure
-  It is 31 percent of all global deaths
- Cardiovascular Diseases are the number one cause of death globally

**Cardiovascular health is important!**

## Usage

### Dataset 

The dataset used for this project is the one published in the "[Survival analysis of heart failure patients A case study](https://plos.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Survival_analysis_of_heart_failure_patients_A_case_study/5227684/1)" by Tanvir Ahmad, Assia Munir, Sajjad Haider Bhatti, Muhammad Aftab, Muhammad Ali Raza.

It contains 299 heart failure patients records who were aged 40 years or above, having LVSD and falling in NYHA class III and IV. All the information were taken from blood reports and physicianâ€™s notes that patients were admitted to Institute of Cardiology and Allied hospital Faisalabad, Pakistan. The CSV file of dataset contains 13 fields inc.;
- Follow up time
- Age
- Ejection Fraction
- Serum Creatinine
- Gender
- Smoking status
- Blood Pressure

## Int Elligence 

We are team Int Elligence, a group of undergraduate students from the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT). This project **"Kardia"** is carried out as part of our research conducted for the Software Development Group Project for the BEng (Hons) Software Engineering at Informatics Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka, affiliated with the University of Westminster, UK.
